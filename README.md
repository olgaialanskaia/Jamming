This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## INTRODUCTION

In this project, I have built a React web application called Jammming. I used my knowledge of React components, state, and requests with the Spotify API and built a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## FEATURES

Below is a list of the website's features:

* Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account.

* Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library (find Spotify endpoints here).

* Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.

* Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.

* Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.

* Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.

* Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.
